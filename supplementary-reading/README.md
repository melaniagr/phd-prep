# supplementary reading, lectures, webinars and so on

I mean to upload here some other material I dive into, that is not included in the study plan but equally valuable.
I intend to upload my handwritten notes and then a short synthesis and / or analysis.

## lecture Notes (Handwritten, scanned)

### Decision-Making Foundations

- **[Kishida, 2024] The Neuroscience of Decision Making**
    - [Scanned notes](https://github.com/melaniagr/phd-prep/blob/main/supplementary-reading/decision-making/neuroscience%20of%20decision%20making%2C%20kishida%2C%20lecture.pdf)
    - Key concepts: emotional, real-time, moment-to-moment dopamine teaching signals that drive decisions and constrain subjective experience.

- **[O'Doherty, 2010] Risk: The Neural Basis of Decision Making**

    - Key concepts: Standardization gaps, missing-data-as-signal, subjective context.

### Gaming & Cognitive Enhancement

- **[Foecker, 2021] Your Brain and You: Video Games to Cognition**
    - [Scanned notes](https://github.com/melaniagr/phd-prep/blob/main/supplementary-reading/gaming-cognition/from%20video%20games%20to%20cognition%2C%20focker%2C%20webinar%20notes.pdf)
