# Learning Journey: Clinical Neuroscience → Computational Cognitive Science

## Background

I hold an MD from Universidad de la República, Uruguay, where biostatistics formed part of our curriculum. Prior to medicine, I completed Year 1 of Engineering (~690 hours, or 165 UK credits of mathematics, programming, and physics)—a foundation that shaped my current mathematical intuition and continues to inform how I approach problem-solving.

## Experience: Implementation Science & Domain Expertise

### Humanitarian Sector (ICRC)

Two years in the humanitarian sector with the ICRC directly applied implementation science: supporting hospital operations, designing behavioral-level training evaluation, and contributing to the Surgical Learning Hub. The second year focused on change management for digital health projects—particularly the DCMS—which provided crucial insight into real-world constraints for intervention design in underserved contexts.

### Clinical Practice (NHS)

I spent nearly 20 months navigating UK medical licensing (PLAB examinations and credentialing), followed by more than two years in the NHS across neurosurgery, plastic surgery, and critical care. These clinical roles deepened my domain knowledge of neurocognitive mechanisms and the real-world complexities of clinical decision-making under uncertainty.

### Values & Social Impact

Throughout these years, I have pursued personal projects grounded in social justice—founding the NGO SOFAI and co-authoring a documentary on intersectional struggles. These reflect my commitment to translating lived experience into meaningful action.

## Learning Goal

My learning goal is to transition from clinical neuroscience to computational cognitive science—bridging mechanistic understanding with real-world application.

## Five Interconnected Workstreams -

I have structured my learning across five interconnected workstreams:

1. **Innovation & Programming** – From digital health fundamentals to Machine Learning for Healthcare, Python, and reinforcement learning

2. **Mathematics** – Foundations for ML: calculus, linear algebra, optimization

3. **Neuroscience** – Building from cellular mechanisms to systems and cognition (refreshing medical school knowledge with computational perspective)

4. **Research & QI** – Meaningful research design, implementation science, applied statistics, with grounding in NHS innovation pathways

5. **Hands-on Projects** – EMG bioamplifier, signal processing, RL models—developing concept ownership through building


## - in 3 progressive phases 
```
Phase 1: Introductory Evidence
↓
Research initiation + Clinical credibility + QI mindset
↓
Phase 2: Foundations
↓
Technical literacy (AI/ML) + Neuroscience foundations + Improvement methodology
↓
Phase 3: In-Depth Learning
↓
Mathematical rigor + Systems neuroscience + Computational skills + Real research
↓
PhD-Ready: Computational Cognitive Science Researcher
```

## Why This Order Matters

The order has been deliberate — e.g. Reinforcement Learning might seem interesting and appealing, but without proper math foundations will be harder to grasp.

## Current Phase

Currently, I am about to dedicate myself plainly to phase 3. I still need to work on my math refreshers in depth, as well as understanding python language and machine learning, but I can also, spontaneously, read papers or watch lectures, and build with my own hands devices or codes that feel naturally embedded  in a path that slowly starts to converge.
