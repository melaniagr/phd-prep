In this repo I have uploaded so far all the relevant documents for Computational Cognitive Science PhD Preparation. 

After dozens of iterations, I settled on a study plan: 5 workstreams (Innovation/AI, Math, Neuroscience, Research+QI, Hands-on Projects) organized into 3 phases by depth: Introductory → Foundational → In Depth.

This design has the following logic: 

```
Phase 1: Introductory Evidence
↓
Research initiation + Clinical credibility + QI mindset
↓
Phase 2: Foundations
↓
Technical literacy (AI/ML) + Neuroscience foundations + Improvement methodology
↓
Phase 3: In-Depth Learning
↓
Mathematical rigor + Systems neuroscience + Computational skills + Real research
↓
PhD-Ready: Computational Cognitive Science Researcher
```

There are plenty of documents, but the overall structure can be simplified as:

**[phase 1](https://github.com/melaniagr/phd-prep/tree/main/phase-1-introductory):** documentation for research and QI, including published research, Consultant's endorsements, QI documentation and certificates. There are also certificates regarding the Innovation, Programming and AI stream, which were an amazing introduction to the world of Innovation for healthcare.

*Companion Portfolio:* [Research & Quality Improvement Portfolio](https://github.com/melaniagr/research-and-qi-portfolio) showcases applied research and clinical leadership outcomes.

**[phase 2](https://github.com/melaniagr/phd-prep/tree/main/phase-2-foundations):** documentation for foundational courses in ML for healthcare, python, pre-calculus, QI-in-depth programme and introductory neuroscience courses.

**[phase 3](https://github.com/melaniagr/phd-prep/tree/main/phase-3-in-depth):** this is the in-depth phase, in which I dive mainly in mathematical, computational, neuroscientific and hands-on-research projects in order to be at PhD level. 

**[weekly reflections](https://github.com/melaniagr/phd-prep/tree/main/weekly-reflections)** I started this to organise my mind and my learning whilst managing so many workstreams.

**[supplementary reading](https://github.com/melaniagr/phd-prep/tree/main/supplementary-reading)** will contain ad-hoc materials that I find useful.

**[progress-tracker](https://github.com/melaniagr/phd-prep/blob/main/progress-tracker.md)** this file is meant to give clarity on where I stand.

Each folder has a in-depth readme file with structure.

I intend to continue editing the content as time passes by and will include reflections where I find they are needed.

Gracias!
