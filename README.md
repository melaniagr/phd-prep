In this repo I have uploaded relevant documents for Computational Cognitive Science PhD Preparation. 

After dozens of iterations, I settled on a study plan: 5 workstreams (Innovation/AI, Math, Neuroscience, Research+QI, Hands-on Projects) organized into 3 phases by depth: Introductory → Foundational → In Depth. My background and rationale for my learning journey sits at ([learning journey](https://github.com/melaniagr/phd-prep/blob/main/learning_journey.md)).

There are plenty of documents, a quick way to navigate them:

**my vision**   
→ [Why computational cognitive science?](https://github.com/melaniagr/phd-prep/blob/main/research-statement-why-computational-cognitive-science.md) is a research statement explaining the journey that has taken me here.

**professional track record**   
→ *Companion Portfolio:* [Research & Quality Improvement Portfolio](https://github.com/melaniagr/research-and-qi-portfolio) showcases applied research and clinical leadership outcomes. Notably, the [DCMS case study](https://github.com/melaniagr/research-and-QI-portfolio/blob/main/3-international-health-systems/dcms-implementation-case-study.md) demonstrates how understanding human behaviour in complex systems directly informs my computational cognitive science research.

**PhD prep structure**   
→ [phase 1](https://github.com/melaniagr/phd-prep/tree/main/phase-1-introductory): most of the content of this phase has been diverted to the Research and QI Portfolio and the Certificates repo - still has minimal content regarding this phase. 

→ [phase 2](https://github.com/melaniagr/phd-prep/tree/main/phase-2-foundations): documentation for foundational courses in ML for healthcare, python, pre-calculus, QI-in-depth programme and introductory neuroscience courses.

→ [phase 3](https://github.com/melaniagr/phd-prep/tree/main/phase-3-in-depth): this is the in-depth phase, in which I dive mainly in mathematical, computational, neuroscientific and hands-on-research projects in order to be at PhD level. 

→ [certificates](https://github.com/melaniagr/certificates): I've created a different repo for the certificates.

→ [weekly reflections](https://github.com/melaniagr/phd-prep/tree/main/weekly-reflections) I started this to organise my mind and my learning whilst managing so many workstreams.

→ [supplementary reading](https://github.com/melaniagr/phd-prep/tree/main/supplementary-reading) will contain ad-hoc materials that I find useful.

→ [progress-tracker](https://github.com/melaniagr/phd-prep/blob/main/progress-tracker.md) this file is meant to give clarity on where I stand.

---

Each folder has a in-depth readme file with structure.

I intend to continue editing the content as time passes by and will include reflections where I find they are needed.

Gracias!
