# Weekly Reflection: February 2nd, 2026

## Reflections

Last week felt slightly overwhelming—job interview, PhD application submission, GitHub expansion, and course completions (Neuropsychology of Decision-Making, Introduction to Cognitive Sciences) all converged while I started deeper reading into mathematical modeling (drift-diffusion models). I delayed the DelftX pre-calculus exam to allow careful review of notes and completion of Coursera courses that offer certification and continued content access post-subscription.

Feels great that the structural setup now feels largely in place. The focus has shifted from building foundations to deepening and refining—which feels more sustainable and engaging.

## Goals for This Week

**Priority 1: Finalize Core Courses**
- Complete 1–2 Imperial Mathematics for ML modules (Linear Algebra / Multivariate Calculus)
- Complete fMRI Fundamentals 1 (Johns Hopkins)

**Priority 2: Python Immersion**
- Deep engagement with MITx 6.00.1x (Introduction to Computer Science and Programming Using Python)
- First deadline: Thursday, Feb 5

**Priority 3: Clinical & Literature Integration**
- Review clinical concepts essential for PhD research
- Progress through computational cognitive science literature (drift-diffusion, RL, decision-making papers)
