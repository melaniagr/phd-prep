# weekly reflection: January 26, 2026

## reflections

I am managing different workstreams (github documentation, phd apps, course completion), and my learning plan has different streams in different phases, plus I am always "curioseando" new lectures / webinars, so I need to prioritise well how I spend my time. The challenge isn't the volume—it's the context switching. Each workstream requires different cognitive modes: organizational (GitHub), narrative (PhD apps), problem-solving (coursework), and strategic planning (Phase 3).

The github upload process has been more time-intensive than expected as  because it's my first time in the platform  and the structure, courses and others I was following were not intended for uploading. I feel how everything is getting tidier and this helps me organise myself ahead of future activities - where I intend to have organised materials earlier on, clarifying my learning.

## last week:

### github repository setup
- created and initialized `phd-prep` github repository
- started uploading documentation from:
  - completed courses
  - lecture notes
  - research readings and papers
- challenge: material wasn't originally intended for public sharing → requires processing and context-building

### phd applications
- spent significant time on phd applications (multiple programs)
- ongoing process alongside other commitments

## goals for this week

**priority 1:** finalize github uploading
- get all existing documentation organized and published
- create clear structure for phase 1, 2, and 3 content

**priority 2:** phase 2 wrap-up
- complete pending courses/items
- document learnings
- free up capacity for phase 3

**priority 3:** parallel phd applications
- continue with application deadlines
- prepare supporting documents
