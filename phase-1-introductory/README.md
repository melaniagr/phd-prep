### key concepts: 

**clinical systems foundation**:
- understand how innovation actually translates to healthcare
- systems thinking (not just individual molecules/algorithms)
- evidence-based decision making (HTA, QI frameworks)

**bridge to computational cognitive science**:
- RL models must improve patient outcomes
- understanding implementation barriers (clinical reality)
- quality metrics for real-world deployment
