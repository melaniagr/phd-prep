# Research & Quality Improvement Portfolio

## Overview

8 projects spanning clinical QI leadership (UK acute care), systematic audit with national validation, independent international health systems research, and published epidemiological research. Demonstrates progression from clinical problem-solving → measurement and peer validation → independent research design and execution → publication and research continuation.

---

## Published Research: 

**MD Thesis: Childhood Obesity & Beverage Consumption (Uruguay)**
- Initiated research partnership with national Ceibal Programme (laptops for every child) to reach rural/under-resourced schools
- Published in *Revista de la Sociedad Uruguaya de Pediatría* (2018)
- Work continued by pediatrics trainees and faculty; awarded prize for independent research excellence
- **Demonstrates:** Research vision, innovation in study design, ability to inspire continuation by academic teams

## UK Clinical Practice: QI & Audit

**QI Leadership & Audit Cycle (5 projects)**

| Category | Projects | Scale | Evidence |
|----------|----------|-------|----------|
| **QI Improvements** (Neurosurgery, ARI) | 3 projects led with junior doctors: VTE prophylaxis, medicine reconciliation, anticoagulant guidance | Team-led | Reports, presentations, endorsements |
| **Audit + Literature Review** (Neurosurgery, ARI) | iNPWD spinal fusions: literature synthesis, baseline audit, intervention, re-audit | National scope | Full report, Scottish Spine Surgeons presentation |
| **QI Projects** (Plastic Surgery, ARI) | 2 projects: pathway efficiency, CEPOD utilization analysis (led independently) | Departmental scope | Presentations, endorsements |

**Demonstrates:** Problem identification, team leadership and mentorship, evidence synthesis, implementation, data analysis, stakeholder engagement, peer validation.

## International Health Systems Research: ICRC

**Independent Research: Basic Emergency Care Training Evaluation**

- **Setting:** Honduras, El Salvador, Mexico (2020-2021); 75 health workers, 5 courses
- **Your Role:** Conceived, designed evaluation framework, led data gathering and analysis
- **Methodology:** Kirkpatrick Level 3 (mixed-methods: 19-question survey, quantitative + qualitative)
- **Finding:** 75%+ behavioral improvement across 7 clinical domains; simulations most effective; resource constraints as barriers
- **Evidence:** Evaluation report, methodology portfolio, thematic analysis

**Demonstrates:** Research conception and execution, health systems evaluation expertise, mixed-methods design, behavioral change measurement, systems-level thinking, international context navigation.

### key concepts: 

**clinical systems foundation**:
- understand how innovation actually translates to healthcare
- systems thinking (not just individual molecules/algorithms)
- evidence-based decision making (HTA, QI frameworks)

**bridge to computational cognitive science**:
- RL models must improve patient outcomes
- understanding implementation barriers (clinical reality)
- quality metrics for real-world deployment
