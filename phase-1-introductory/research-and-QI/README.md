## research & QI evidence

### Overview
Completed **6 quality improvement and clinical audit projects** across Neurosurgery and Plastic Surgery at Aberdeen Royal Hospital (NHS Grampian), working alongside consultant supervisors. Projects ranged from leading team-based basic QI improvements to independently conducting literature reviews, multi-cycle audits, and presenting findings at national conferences.

**Total project hours:** ~380-500 hours of data gathering, analysis, team coordination, intervention design, and presentation

### Neurosurgery Projects (Aberdeen Royal Infirmary)

#### 1. VTE Prophylaxis Assessment & Prescribing
**Role:** Led junior doctor team  
**Scope:** Assessment of venous thromboembolism prophylaxis protocols and prescribing accuracy  
**Methods:** Data gathering from patient records, prescribing audit, analysis of compliance  
**Deliverables:** Audit report, departmental presentation, recommendations for protocol improvement  
**Impact:** Identified gaps in VTE prophylaxis documentation and prescribing; improved clinical safety

---

#### 2. Medicine Reconciliation Documentation
**Role:** Led junior doctor team  
**Scope:** Audit of medication reconciliation documentation at hospital discharge  
**Methods:** Retrospective review of discharge summaries, compliance assessment, gap analysis  
**Deliverables:** Audit report, standardized documentation protocol, team training  
**Impact:** Improved discharge summary quality; reduced medication errors; enhanced patient safety

---

#### 3. Anticoagulant/Antiplatelet Guidance in Discharge Summaries
**Role:** Led junior doctor team  
**Scope:** Evaluation of long-term anticoagulant and antiplatelet guidance provided to patients at discharge  
**Methods:** Systematic review of discharge documentation, assessment of clarity and completeness  
**Deliverables:** Audit findings, improved guidance template, departmental implementation  
**Impact:** Standardized patient discharge information; reduced confusion about medication management; improved patient outcomes

#### 4. Incisional Negative Pressure Wound Dressings (iNPWD) for Spinal Fusions
**Role:** Led full project independently  
**Supervisor:** Mr. Mohit Arora, Consultant Neurosurgeon  
**Scope:** Comprehensive literature review + local audit of iNPWD outcomes in spinal fusion procedures

Abstract:

**Background:** While NICE-approved guidance exists for iNPWD use in colorectal, cardiothoracic, vascular, and orthopedic surgery, there is no clear guidance for spinal surgery. Use is based on surgeon preference rather than evidence-based indications.

**Methods:**
- **Literature Review:** Systematic review of published evidence on iNPWD in spinal fusion procedures
- **Retrospective Audit:** Analysis of 182 consecutive spinal fusion cases (July 2021 - July 2023) at ARI
  - Identified 15 cases where iNPWD was used (13 prophylactically)
  - Compared to 13 demographically matched controls without iNPWD
  - Data sources: inpatient notes, discharge letters, outpatient follow-up records

**Key Findings:**
- **iNPWD group (n=13):** 0% surgical site infection (SSI), normal wound healing in all cases
- **Control group (n=13):** 15.4% SSI rate (2/13 patients)
- **Implication:** Potential benefit of prophylactic iNPWD in reducing SSI in spinal fusion procedures

**Conclusions & Recommendations:**
- iNPWD shows promise for spinal fusion procedures but requires further investigation
- Need for prospective studies to establish clear indications and guidelines
- Potential for cost savings and improved patient outcomes with wider implementation

**Impact:** Project escalated to **national presentation at Scottish Spine Surgeons 14th Annual Meeting** (2024), reaching senior surgeons and peers across Scotland. Contributed to emerging evidence base for iNPWD use in spinal surgery.

**Deliverables:** Literature review, audit protocol, data analysis, presentation slides, departmental report

### Plastic Surgery Projects (Aberdeen Royal Infirmary)

#### 5. Local Anaesthesia Pathway Efficiency
**Role:** Supported departmental QI initiative - data gathering  
**Scope:** Analysis of current pathways for patients undergoing procedures under local anaesthesia  
**Methods:** Process mapping, workflow analysis, data collection on procedure timings and efficiency  
**Impact:** Contributed to departmental process improvement; identified bottlenecks and optimization opportunities

---

#### 6. RACH CEPOD Utilization Analysis by Plastics Department
**Role:** Led project independently  
**Scope:** Comprehensive analysis of Royal Aberdeen Children's Hospital (RACH) CEPOD (Confidential Enquiry into Patient Outcome and Death) utilization by the Plastic Surgery Department

**Methods:**
- Developed detailed project protocol and data collection framework
- Gathered utilization data from departmental records and RACH database
- Conducted statistical analysis of usage patterns, trends, and outcomes
- Created presentation summarizing findings and recommendations

**Impact:** Provided department with evidence-based insights into case management practices; identified opportunities for improved perioperative management and documentation; informed departmental strategy for future quality improvement

**Deliverables:** Project protocol, data analysis, presentation
