### Why Computational Cognitive Science?

Since auditing *Synapses, Neurons, and Brains* during the pandemic, I have wanted to pursue computational neuroscience—but I faced real uncertainty about where to start, how to fund it, whether I was equipped, and how it aligned with my commitments in the humanitarian sector and personal projects (launching an NGO, co-authoring a documentary).   

I am a physician who trained originally in engineering alongside theatre. After medical training, I took time to work across Europe and contribute to Medland Project—a photojournalism project documenting people living alternative ways in the Mediterranean. There, I began questioning how information shapes us. It prompted a deeper question: how much does information quality shape human behaviour and decision-making? As the project's creator noted, we add constantly to an already over-informed world. This became central to my thinking: not just *what* information exists, but *how* humans process it—and what I, personally, would responsibly add to an already over-informed world.   

This trajectory led me into the humanitarian sector, where I worked in varied roles for the ICRC—including as change manager for a digital health implementation project. In parallel, I worked on launching a nonprofit and co-authoring a documentary. Once these projects were on their way, I pursued the PLAB route—completing it in an accelerated timeframe while studying independently from Switzerland—before spending two years in NHS clinical specialties. Each role reinforced the same conviction: healthcare innovation is needed to improve care for millions of people, yet fails in translation when it doesn't truly understand the people it is intended for. I became particularly interested in the neurocognitive processes underlying decision-making—but within the broader landscape of computational cognitive science, where human behaviour emerges from systems, constraints, and context.   

In 2024, I discovered AI4Biomed—it aligned with my interests and helped me recognise what a well-designed PhD programme could look like. This opened my eyes to other programmes matching that vision. Unable to pursue immediately, I made a critical decision: to step back from clinical contracts and transition to locum shifts. This freed space for serious study and protected the sleep and cognitive capacity I'd been sacrificing.

In September, I drafted a learning plan for January applications, but I misjudged the scope. I began multiple courses simultaneously—MITx single and multivariable calculus, differential equations, Python—without clear sequencing. I wanted credentials to prove competence, but I was actually dispersing my energy. By trying to do everything at once, I lost focus and efficiency.   

This taught me something fundamental: an organised learning journey matters more than credentials. Structure enables materialisation—you see progress, build momentum, and sustain motivation. After personal circumstances and a brief demotivation phase, I restarted in January with a refined plan. I realised that a coherent path, even without certificates, would serve my actual goal: deep understanding and genuine preparation for PhD-level work.   

I'm building routines that work *with* my ADHD rather than against it. Hyperfocus on intrinsically motivating topics is a genuine asset—it allows me to move through difficult material quickly. But I've also learned to protect time for unexpected detours: random lectures, tangential reading, serendipitous discoveries. This balance between structured depth and explorative breadth, feels essential to doing research well, especially in computational cognition.
