# phase-2-foundations
I will share here the documentation regarding the phase 2 of my study plan (certifications, some notes). This phase disciplinary knowledge and practical skills across three core areas: artificial intelligence and healthcare innovation, neuroscience, and quality improvement methodology.

### My aims were:

**Innovation, programming and AI:** achieve technical literacy and ability to understand emerging technologies in healthcare context.

**Neuroscience:** cognitive sciences and decision-making foundations, to understand the neurobiology underlying health behavious and decision-making. Child and adolescent psychiatry essentials was done to have evidence of my clinical knowledge - as I have shadowed in Psychiatry but not formally worked... yet.

**Research and QI:** I attended the Scottish Improvement Foundation Skills (SIFS) programme, whose aim is "to support individuals to develop the skills, knowledge, and confidence to participate as members of improvement teams and contribute to testing, measuring and reporting on changes made." This seemed a step-up after the introductory courses and hands-on projects I had done in phase I. I upload part of the documentation I created for the programme, that needs to be applied to a real project. Through this programme, I gained skills in practical application of improvement science, ability to design and test interventions and communication of findings.

- **Strategically done all three together:** Developed technical ability to build, neuroscience grounding to design meaningfully, improvement science skills to test and implement
