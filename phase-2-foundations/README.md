# phase-2-foundations
I will share here the documentation regarding the phase 2 of my study plan (certifications, some notes). This phase disciplinary knowledge and practical skills across three core areas: artificial intelligence and healthcare innovation, neuroscience, and quality improvement methodology.

### my aims were:

**Innovation, programming and AI:** achieve technical literacy and ability to understand emerging technologies in healthcare context.

**Neuroscience:** cognitive sciences and decision-making foundations, to understand the neurobiology underlying health behavious and decision-making. Child and adolescent psychiatry essentials was done to have evidence of my clinical knowledge - as I have shadowed in Psychiatry but not formally worked... yet.

**Research and QI:** I attended the Scottish Improvement Foundation Skills (SIFS) programme, which aims to develop skills in improvement science methodology. This represented a natural step-up after the introductory QI courses and projects completed in Phase 1. Through the programme, I gained practical skills in improvement science application, intervention design and testing, and communication of findings. I have uploaded the [detailed documentation of the SIFS project output and certification](https://github.com/melaniagr/research-and-qi-portfolio/tree/main/4-Scottish-improvement-foundation-skills-programme) where I applied these skills to a real departmental initiative.

- **Strategically done all three together:** Developed technical ability to build, neuroscience grounding to design meaningfully, improvement science skills to test and implement

### skills gained in this phase:

**AI & Programming:** ML fundamentals, Python basics, healthcare AI evaluation  
**Neuroscience:** Cognitive sciences, decision-making neurobiology, child psychiatry  
**Research & QI:** Improvement science, intervention design, measurement, real-world application
