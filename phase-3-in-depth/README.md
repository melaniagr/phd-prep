# phase-3-in-depth
Documentation (certificates, notes) of the phase 3 of my learning plan, where I move beyond foundational skills toward PhD-ready mastery.

## Learning Approach

**Mathematics & Computation:** I begin with foundational overview courses (e.g., Math for ML), then deepen through rigorous textbooks and advanced courses via MIT OpenCourseWare, MITx, edX, and Coursera. MIT's XSeries "Computational Thinking with Python" forms the computational backbone of this phase. I will also go deeper in RL with David Silver's course. 

**Neuroscience:** I am completing HarvardX's MicroBachelors in Fundamentals of Neuroscience alongside my first computational neuroscience course, building from systems-level understanding to quantitative modeling.

**Research & Practice:** Simultaneously, I am conducting my largest research project to date—"IMGs' Mental Well-being: A Scoping Review"—as principal investigator under faculty supervision. I am also designing my first hands-on project: an EMG bioamplifier, where I learn by building and analyzing real data.

**Integration:** Each area is supplemented with strategic reading, lectures, and additional courses to ensure depth and interconnection across mathematics, neuroscience, computation, and applied research.

## structure

My aims are: 
- Gain mathematical tools to model neural circuits and analyze brain data
- Understand algorithms and optimization for processing neuroimaging and biosignals
- Implementing computational models of decision-making; analyzing real neuroimaging/EMG data
- Ability to design experiments, collect neural data, process it mathematically, and interpret findings
